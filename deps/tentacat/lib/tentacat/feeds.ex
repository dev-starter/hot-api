  GitHub provides several timeline resources in Atom format. The Feeds API lists all the feeds available to the authenticating user:

  Timeline: The GitHub global public timeline
  User: The public timeline for any user, using URI template
  Current user public: The public timeline for the authenticated user
  Current user: The private timeline for the authenticated user
  Current user actor: The private timeline for activity created by the authenticated user
  Current user organizations: The private timeline for the organizations the authenticated user is a member of.
  Note: Private feeds are only returned when authenticating via Basic Auth since current feed URIs use the older, non revokable auth tokens.

  ## Example

      Tentacat.Users.Feeds
