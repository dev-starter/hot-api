  Retrieves a list of all keys in the cache.

  We only return the keys for items which have not yet expired. This means that
  if there are items currently inside the cache which are set to be removed by
  the next purge call, they will not be included in this count.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
