  # This module controls the implementation of the Expire action. Expiring has
  # to deal with several scenarios, including the removal of an expiration (as
  # `:expire` is used as a delegate for `:persist`). The Expire action executes
  # in a lock-aware context which ensures consistency against Transactions.

  @doc """
  Sets the expiration time on a given record.

  If the expiration time is negative, we immediately remove the record from the
  cache due to a purge. If it's non-negative, we set the touch time to be the
  current time and the TTL to be the given expire time. If the expiration is nil,
  this means we need to remove the TTL, and so we remove the TTL field by setting
  it to nil. This is done implicitly through the fact that `nil > -1 == true`.

  This action executes inside a Transaction to ensure that there are no keys currently
  under a lock - thus ensuring consistency.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
