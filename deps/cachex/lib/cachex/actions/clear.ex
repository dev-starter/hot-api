  # removing all items from inside the cache, regardless of whether they should
  # have been evicted or not.

  Clears all items in a cache.

  We return the number of items current inside the cache when we clear it. This
  action executes inside a Transaction to ensure that there are no keys currently
  under a lock - thus ensuring consistency.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
