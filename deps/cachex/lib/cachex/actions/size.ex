  # uses the built in ETS info commands to retrieve the number of records currently

  Retrieve the size of the cache.

  Expirations do not matter at this point, the size purely represents the number
  of records which currently populate the cache. If you need a count taking the
  expiration into account, please use the Count action.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.
