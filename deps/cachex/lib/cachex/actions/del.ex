  @doc """
  Removes a given item from the cache.

  This function will always return a truthy response, which signals that regardless
  of whether the key existed in the cache previously, it is guaranteed to not
  exist any longer.

  We execute the delete calls under a LockManager context to ensure that we're
  respective of any Transaction locks currently being held against the key.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.

      { :ok, :ets.delete(cache, key) }
