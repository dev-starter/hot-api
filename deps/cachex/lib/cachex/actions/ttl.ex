  # between the touch and ttl fields inside a record. The implementation also
  # accounts for expirations in order to ensure consistency in results provided
  # to the developer.

  @doc """
  Retrieves the remaining TTL for a cache item.

  If the cache item has no TTL, a nil value is returned. If the item is missing,
  a nil is returned, tagged with a :missing flag. Otherwise a Tuple of :ok and
  the remaining time to list (in milliseconds) is returned.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.

  # Handles the record coming back from the read. We normalize the TTL value at

  # the time remaining and return that to the user. If the record does not exist,
  # we just return a missing result.
