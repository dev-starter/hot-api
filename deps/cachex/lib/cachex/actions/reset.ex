  Resets various pieces of a cache.

  We can reset either a list of hooks, all hooks, the cache table, or both. We
  do this by reusing the Clear action to empty the cache as needed, and by using
  the reset listener inside a Hook server.

  Nothing in here will notify hooks of the reset as it's quite redundant and it's
  evident that a reset happened when you see that your hook has reinitialized.
