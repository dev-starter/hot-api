  @doc """
  Executes a Transaction against the cache.

  The LockManager does the heavy lifting here, we just provide the cache state
  to the user's provided function. We wrap the result in an ok Tuple just to
  protect against people unwrapping values using bang functions on the Cachex
  interface.

  There are currently no recognised options, the argument only exists for future
  proofing.

    LockManager.transaction(state, keys, fn ->
      { :ok, operation.(state) }
