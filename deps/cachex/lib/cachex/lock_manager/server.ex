  # This module contains the backing GenServer process for the LockManager which
  # handles all writes to the ETS tables which execute in a locked context. There
  # are two interfaces here; a transactional call which will automatically handle
  # table locking on the keys being worked on, and a simple execution interface.
  # The execution interface does little beyond execute the provided function, but
  # it provides the guarantee that the function is exeuting at a time when there
  # are no locks currently held on the table. This has the advantage of allowing
  # writes to act eagerly but back up into this process if they hit a key lock.

  writing them, and forcing those processes to queue their writes up inside this
