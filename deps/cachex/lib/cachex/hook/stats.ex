  Initializes a new stats Map.

  We set a `:creationDate` field inside the `:meta` sub-Map to contain the date
  that the statistics were first created.

  Registers actions against the stats container.

  If a request to the cache has errored for any reason, we don't track it just
  to ensure that we don't have any false positives of actions taken. The heavy
  lifting here is done by the logic in `Cachex.Stats` where it's generic, rather
  than being embedded into the Hook definition itself.
