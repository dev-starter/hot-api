  # This module provides an eviction policy for Cachex, evicting the least-recently
  # written entries from the cache. This is determined by the touched time inside
  # each cache record, which means that this eviction is almost zero cost, consuming
  # no additional memory beyond that of the running GenServer.
  #
  # This policy accepts a reclaim space to determine how much of the cache to evict,
  # allowing the user to determine exactly how much they'd like to trim in the event
  # they've gone over the limit.
  #
  # This eviction is relatively fast, and should keep the cache below bounds at most
  # times. Note that many writes in a very short amount of time can flood the cache,
  # but it should recover given a few seconds.

  # Suggest stepping through this pipeline a function at a time and reading the
  # associated comments. This pipeline controls the trimming of the cache to fit
  # the appropriate size.
  #
  # We start with the current size of the cache and pass it through to a function
  # which will calculate the a number of slots to reclaim in the cache. If the
  # number is positive, we carry out a Janitor purge and see if that brings us
  # back under the maximum size. If so, we're done and stop. If not, we then trim
  # the cache using a QLC cursor through the cache, deleting entries in batches.
  # Note that these deletions are sorted by the touch time to ensure we delete
  # the oldest first.
  #
  # Upon completion, we notify the worker itself to broadcast a message to all
  # hooks to ensure that hooks are notified of the evictions. This is only done
  # in the case that something has actually been removed, in order to avoid edge
  # cases and potentially breaking existing hook implementations.
  #
  # It's safe to always run through the pipeline here, but we check the cache
  # size as an optimization to speed up message processing when no evictions need
  # to happen. This is a slight speed boost, but it's noticeable - tests will fail
  # intermittently if this is not checked in this way.
